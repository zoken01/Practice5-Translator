    "- LSTM mejora bastante las predicciones con respecto a GRU (GRU: 1 y 5, el resto LSTM)\n",
    "- Utilizar encoder/decoder también mejora las predicciones (modelos 0 y 8 vs el resto)\n",
    "- Utilizar una capa de words embedding mejora el modelo (modelo 0 vs 8)\n",
    "- Mayor complejidad en este caso mejora (modelo 2 vs 0)\n",
    "- Modelo bidireccional por sí solo no es muy bueno, con una capa bidireccional se hace mejor (7 - bidreccional vs 6 - con embedding)\n",
    "- RNN y LSTM utilizan mucha memoria y por lo tanto su uso es limitado. Se necesita mucha potencia de procesamiento para que sea rentable utilizar este tipo de redes.\n",
    "- De hecho, las redes Convolucionales Temporales presentan resultados muy superiores a los delas tradicionales redes recurrentes como LSTM en muchos datasets (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01271)\n",
    "- En realidad se sabe muy poco de cómo el cerebro humano aprende y memoriza las secuencias. Muchos estudios muestran que no leemos secuencialmente, y que de hecho interpretamos los caracteres, palabras y frases como grupos.\n",
    "- Varias pruebas comparando la efectivdad de LSTM contra la de los _Transmoformers_ (redes basadas en atención) muestran que esta última presenta mejores resultados en la mayoría de los casos de uso (https://openai.com/blog/language-unsupervised/, https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)"
